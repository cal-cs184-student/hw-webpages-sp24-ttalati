        <h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>
	This assignment was split into two main sections. The first dealt with Bezier Curves and Surfaces whereas the second dealt with Triangle Meshes as well as manipulating them through the Half-Edge data structure. 
	</p>

	<p>
	In the first section we implemented the ability to evaluate a bezier curve based on an arbitrary number of control points. This was mainly done through the use of the De Casteljau subdivision algorithm, which defines a recursive function, consisting of multiple linear interpolations between every consecutive control point to determine the next set of control points. This recursive process is continued until we evaluate to just a singular point, which determines the actual point on the curve. As we change the ‘t’ parameter, we tend to plot different final endpoints. Varying this t parameter from 0 to 1 plots the entire bezier curve. 
	</p>

	<p>
	In the second part, we extended our functional curve creation algorithm to implement functionality of being able to graph bezier surfaces specified by a 2d array or grid of control points. Our implementation was simplified by the fact that the input grid happened to be square. The way that bezier surface evaluation worked is that the control points along the row of the grid helped evaluate a curve along each row. Particularly at the parameter of ‘u.’ Next this set of points acted as control points for a curve on the vertical axis evaluated specifically at the parameter v. In this manner we formed a systematic way of evaluating the curve on the 2d grid. One thing that was helpful is that we could use our curve evaluation subroutine defined earlier to implement the subparts of this surface evaluation method, helping simplify the logic. 	
	</p>

    <p>
	Next, we moved to the meshes and half-edge manipulation part of the project. The first thing we worked on was implementing logic to assign normals to vertices in our mesh. The assigned normal vector to each vertex was a weighted average of the normal vector of all the surrounding faces to the vertex, where the weight was the area of the face. The motivation for having this assignment was because having normal vectors help with important calculations such as shading when rendering surfaces. The main challenge was first getting used to the Half-Edge data structure, where given the halfedge for the current vertex, we need to iterate through all the other faces that surround that vertex. This was done through just some careful pointer manipulation of the half-edge iterator. Through this iteration we were also able to access the face pointer for each of the surrounding faces and then we utilized the normal method to get the norm of that face. The other thing we had to do was find the area of the face, which was done through a simple cross product norm (and dividing by 2) of the 2 edges that surrounded the face. Now we could simply multiply the normal by the area which we derived. Normalizing this weighted sum gave us our final answer which we were interested in returning.     
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The next task had us implement a common half-edge manipulation called the edge flip. In the edge flip we basically flip the orientation of the common edge between two triangles. This creates two new looking triangles, however no new instances of edges, faces, vertices, or half-edges are introduced in this case. To implement this edge-flip the main challenge was just deducing the set of pointers and values they point to for each structure involved in the edge flip. This was done by first explicitly listing out all the structures and then manually working through the state of the pointers and structures post edge flip. Then once that was worked out, it was simply a task of setting those structs to the corresponding new values as stated in the advice instead of just changing structures that underwent some sort of change.
    </p>

<p>
Edge-split was the other half-edge manipulation that we had to implement. Arguably, this was a bit more involved than the edge-flip since new structures, notably one new vertex, two new faces, three new edges, and 6 new half edges had to be introduced in addition to the fact that some of the old structures now had different pointers due to the fact that we were introducing new triangles and other components as a result of the split. However, due to the practice of pointer manipulation and explicit declaration of all the old structures, much of the work was pretty similar. Specifically we declared a variable for all the old structures and similarly declared the variables for all the new introduced structures; worked out the pointer assignments in the new state after the split manually; then we finally redundantly assigned the new pointers to all the aforementioned variables. Once again like the spec suggested, doing the redundant assignment helped reduce the pains potentially faced with debugging mistakes related to some missing assignments if we only chose to reassign modified pointers or values. 
</p>

<p>In the last part of the project, we implemented mesh upsampling. Specifically, this allowed us to make use of the edge-flip and edge-split functionality that we spent so much time trying to implement thus far in the project. The mechanics of the algorithm to implement mesh upsampling were pretty finely detailed in the spec so it was just a matter of correctly translating those steps into code. Specifically the complexity of trying to upsample lies in two factors: introducing new structures as well as changing the positions of our old structures. However, some of the properties of the new structures depend on the positions and properties of the old ones, which made it important to be careful in the order that changes were made. Specifically, each of the structures had a field that stored the old and new positions as well as a boolean flag which labeled whether or not the structure itself was new or not. Then we computed the new positions of the old vertex (storing into the old vertices’ field) as well as the position of new vertices (which would go inside the edge that would be split to achieve that new vertex). Next we would split every edge and once we split the edge, propagate over the position of the new vertex from the value that was stored inside the edge structure previously. Then we flipped edges that connected one new vertex with another old one (also done through using flags). Finally we have the mesh ready and just need to make the actual position field for all the vertices the one that is stored in their corresponding newPosition field, completing our upsampling.

            <h3>Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision </h3>
            
            
            <p>Basically De Casteljau’s algorithm is a recursive subdivision algorithm that given a list of n control points and a parameter ‘t,’ basically indicates the location along the eventual Bezier Curve we are evaluating by producing n - 1 of the next control points in one step. Recursively applying this step as indicated in the algorithm until we have just 1 point essentially gives us the point that is actually located on the Bezier Curve that we are trying to graph for the specific parameter ‘t.’ To produce n - 1 control points from n control points, we basically linearly interpolate between each two consecutive control points, with ‘t’ acting like our interpolation parameter.

            <h3>Part 2: Bezier Curves with Seperable 1D de Casteljau </h3>
            <p> The nice part about needing to implement Bezier surfaces in this assignment is that we can apply the De Casteljau’s algorithm that we implemented in the earlier part, which evaluates a curve as a subroutine to evaluate points on a surface. As mentioned in the overview section, basically when trying to evaluate points on a surface, we are first defining the bezier surface by a 2d array or grid of control points. In our implementation we were given that this grid was a square. Now, first along the control points in each row helps evaluate a bezier curve along that particular row. Specifically, at the parameter ‘u.’ Now we have n (where n is the size of the side of the control points) evaluated bezier curve points since we applied the De Casteljau algorithm from part 1 on each row of our grid. This new set of n evaluated points function as our control points along the vertical axis and the evaluated point we are worried about is specified by the parameter ‘v.’ So in summary we run n bezier curve evaluations along the row, which gives us n points in one column, which we then plug into as control points in another bezier curve evaluation specified by the parameter v. This two step process then gives us one specific point, parametrized by (u,v). Shifting u and v across their domain then helps plot out the entire surface that our initial control point has defined. In code, this translated over pretty similarly. We defined a function evaluate that would make subsequent calls on the correct rows and later the one column to evaluate1D, with a parameter, which would output the specific point by calling evaluateStep as a subroutine until it only had one point.

            <h3>Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals </h3>
<p> The main challenge with implementing the assignment of vertex normals to be the area-weighted normal vector of all the vertex’s neighboring faces was getting used to the half-edge data structure and coming up with a way to traverse and change pointers in a manner that would lead us to iterating over all of the neighboring faces of a particular vertex. The pattern of traversal that was deduced was start at the current half-edge of the instance vertex that is calling the function. Each half edge is associated with a face so we can query for that. If the face is a boundary face then it is a “virtual face” and we should not have that in our area calculations. If not, we need to update our running weighted sum. We describe the methodology to calculate the weights in a bit. After the weight calculation and sum update is done, pointers are changed in the following manner: we access the twin halfedge (so the halfedge that points into our vertex) and then access the next half edge of the twin in this way in our next iteration inside our loop logic, the face will be the neighboring face and our logic can continue. Due to the structure of the manifolds we are guaranteed to return back to our starting halfedge, which is our ending point of the loop. Once the loop ends, we simply return a normalized version of our running weighted normal vector sum, giving the weighted-normal of the target vertex.
</p>
		<p>Now we describe how to find the weight (which is the area of the triangular face). We know through vector algebra the norm of the cross product of two vectors gives the area of the parallelogram that is formed by those two vectors. Halving that value gives the area of the triangle specified by the two vectors (since two vectors and an angle can form a triangle [recall side angle side congruence]). To find these vectors we need 3 points, one being the vertex and the other 2 being the neighboring ones to form the vector-ray. These neighbors can be found by accessing the current half-edge’s next half-edge and querying for the vertex that it roots and also the current half-edge’s next-next vertex. With these 3 points, we just find the vector from vertex -> point 1 and vertex -> point 2, find the norm of the cross product and divide by 2 to get the area. Then we query for the actual norm of the face by simply using the member function of the Face class and multiply it by the calculated average and add it to our running sum. The final sum clearly is the weighted sum of all the neighboring face-norms, which can be used to find the final answer as indicated in the previous paragraph.

            <h3>Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>

            <p>The spec provided some really helpful tips that made the implementation of the edge flip more painless. Specifically, stating that we should just reassign all of the pointers for all of structures involved (namely vertices, edges, half-edges, and faces) probably saved a lot of time compared to if we proceeded with the alternative option of trying to find our which structures had a change in pointers and only attempting to modify those. Similarly this advice motivated the idea of first assigning all the involved structures into a variable first and then mechanically reassigning the pointers and swapping things as deemed necessary.</p>

		<p>At a high level the edge flip is changing the vertices that connect a certain edge along the other two points out of the 4 points involved in the two triangles that share the edge. In terms of the actual mechanics of implementing the edge flip one important thing to notice is that no new structures are created to implement this functionality. Therefore, we just need to reassign existing ones. So once we listed out all the structures (vertices a, b, c, d; half-edges ac, cd, db, ba, cb, bc; edges ac, cd, db, ba; faces 1 and 2) on paper we drew out the post-flip state of our 2-triangle geometry and reassigned the appropriate changes. For instance the face of half-edge cd was changed to correspond to the face 1 instead of it being in face 2 as it was previously. Some other half edges also had changes to their next value, specifically the ones on the edge that was flipped. Because of these multiple changes, we just used the post-condition to completely reassign all the values of the pointers. Other structures that we had to modify were the face and vertex pointers. Here the modification was just to make sure that the half-edge they point to actually still corresponds to a half-edge that represents the face or vertex because those could be changed and we could have wrong pointers. The code provides a list of the exact changes but this was the gist of the main challenges of the problem. </p>

      <p class="left">Initially while implementing this functionality, I thought for some reason I could reasonably visualize all the pointer changes mentally and proceeded to write the code. Perhaps predictably one could imagine this did not bode well. Then—like I should have done earlier—I pulled out a pencil and paper, drew up the toy example and labeled the key structures both before and after the flip. This made life much easier as the work of the before and after stage was already on paper and I just had to carefully replicate it in code now. Attached for no real purpose is the pen-paper masterpiece.</p>

	<p class="left">The implementation was not too bad as I had a lot of pointer manipulation practice from the regular edge-split and edge-flip implementation. The subtly to note is that only one new triangle inside is created and there is one new half-edge that exists on the boundary. After noting those, the steps that proceed are the same as just carefully reassigning pointers in any other case.</p>

        <section>
             <h3>Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
            <p> In a nutshell, in the edge split operation, we attach a new vertex at the midpoint of the edge we are trying to split and then create an edge in the same direction as if we were trying to flip the selected edge. Now the original two triangles have been partitioned into four separate triangles. This means there are 2 new faces (since we have two new triangles), one new vertex (the midpoint), three new edges (across the midpoint), and also six new half-edges. Other than that the rest of the challenge is just reassigning pointers in the old structures to either the new structures that are created through the split or to a new location as a result of the split. Therefore, the edge split follows much of the same basic steps as the flip except we are also adding new structures. Specifically, to tackle the split, like with the flip we first initialized variables for all the structures involved  (vertices a, b, c, d; half-edges ac, cd, db, ba, cb, bc; edges ac, cd, db, ba; faces 1 and 2). Then initialize the new structures that will be introduced post flip (vertex m; faces 3, 4; 6 new half-edges, 3 new edges). Once all of these structures were initialized, the task becomes the same as in the flip-case: correctly populate the field variables of the structures. The most complicated assignments are for the half-edges, but working through a drawn diagram can allow us to systematically label the next half-edge, face, vertex, and twin pointers. Then we simply need to make sure that each of the face, vertex, and edge structures have a correct pointer to the right half-edge. Candidly, there is no real smart algorithm, these pointer adjustments just have to be carefully assigned by just assigning as the drawing of the post-split state indicates. 
</p>
<p>
One thing that helped make this process much smoother was actually giving nice names to the structures instead of the rather unreadable and uninterpretable names we gave them when doing the flip operation implementation. Specifically I labeled the vertices a, b, c, d and edges similarly instead of just using numbers. This way I had a much easier time translating the drawn image state into the actual code that implements that logic.

		<p>Initially while trying to implement half-edge splitting I had quite unreadable variable names, which did not help in making my job of deciding where pointers lie easier. After trying to get this version working, I decided to give the variables more descriptive names (corresponding with the actual labels I had on my paper diagram). This made it much faster and easier to implement the splitting function.

             <h3>Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>

        <p>
	Basically loop subdivision is a method to upsample our given mesh and as mentioned in the overview, relies heavily on our edge-split and flip functionality we worked on. The mechanics of the algorithm to implement mesh upsampling were pretty finely detailed in the spec so it was just a matter of correctly translating those steps into code. Specifically the complexity of trying to upsample lies in two factors: introducing new structures as well as changing the positions of our old structures. However, some of the properties of the new structures depend on the positions and properties of the old ones, which made it important to be careful in the order that changes were made. Specifically, each of the structures had a field that stored the old and new positions as well as a boolean flag which labeled whether or not the structure itself was new or not. Then we computed the new positions of the old vertex (storing into the old vertices’ field) as well as the position of new vertices (which would go inside the edge that would be split to achieve that new vertex). Both the position of the new position of the old vertex and the position of the new vertex were calculated according to the loop division formula that was given. While the subdivision and the edge split and flip of the triangle were described earlier it is easier to calculate out all the positions and then deal with the geometric flipping and splitting that would place the right structures at the right location.	
	</p>

		<p>Next we would split every edge and once we split the edge, utilizing the edge split subroutine. While doing this we propagate over the position of the new vertex from the value that was stored inside the edge structure previously. One thing that we had to be careful about was not splitting newly created edges, but that could be determined easily (if either of the vertices that make up the edge were newly created then the edge is new and we ignore it). 
		</p>

	<p>
	After edge splitting was done, we then flipped edges that connected one new vertex with another old one (also done through using a simple xor on the vertex-is-new flags). And once we determined that an edge needed to be flipped we simply called the flipEdge function we created earlier. Another subtlety here is we had to make sure to only flip new edges since old edges should not be flipped no matter the state of the vertex, which could also be determined by a simple conditional statement on the flags.	
	</p>

	<p>
	Finally we have the mesh ready and just need to make the actual position field for all the vertices the one that is stored in their corresponding newPosition field, completing our upsampling. 	
	</p>

	<p>
	When looking at the behavior of sharp corners and edges under loop subdivision, it is evident these sharp parts of the geometry have a much harsher/larger change at each level of upsample than non sharp corners and edges. Specifically compared to the original geometry, the upsampled version pulls in these corners and edges much more in an effort to make the overall geometry more rounded. Since sharp corners and edges see a much larger inward pull effect than non sharp ones, we disproportionately change the geometry or shrink the sharper areas compared to the non-sharper ones, leading to asymmetry. This also makes sense as in sharper corners, the locations of the other vertices in comparison to ours are much more different, so when we apply the weighted averaging step, we are going to see a large change in the new location of our vertex in the upsampled version, whereas in non-sharp corners and edges our change is not going to be as drastic. In either case our figure does get smaller but that change slows down at larger iterations of upsampling. One reason why we have this disproportionate figure is because the vertices are unevenly distributed. If we were to introduce symmetry on the locations and spacing of the vertex in our figure through splits, we can make our upsampling effect be the same throughout the geometry of our figure, curtailing the asymmetry issue. I show this in the example with fixing the cube.

        <p class="caption">Comparing the various levels of upscaling it is clear that sharp corners have a much larger inward movement effect compared to non sharp ones when we upscale. Due to this disproportionate movement, we see the eventual asymmetry. 
</p>

		<p>One thing I did to make the cube divide more symmetrically is make each of the faces the sample geometrically by splitting an edge on every face. This way the sharpness of the corners decreases as neighboring vertices are closer to each other and two all vertices will have similar neighbor topologies. One can imagine that increasing the number of triangles that make up our cube symmetrically will do an even better job at maintaining symmetry through various upsampling levels.

		<h4 class="left">Extra Credit: Support meshes with boundary</h4>
		<p class="left">In implementing supporting upscaling on the boundary at the boundary, I first looked up the rules for assigning new vertex (on the edge structure) and old vertex positions (on the vertex structure itself). This was found in the lecture slides on the lecture for Mesh Processing. Specifically the new position for old vertices corresponds to ⅛ * (sum of adjacent boundary vertex on boundary edges) + ¾ * (current vertex position). Similarly the update rule for a new vertex position is quite simple ½ * (sum of vertex positions that make up the edge). Once I knew these rules, much of the skeleton to add them in our upscale method already existed. Specifically I only had to add conditionals in the existing for loops that calculated new positions for old vertices and also the new positions on edges so they can be set on new vertices. The conditional corresponds to whether or not the edge or vertex I am dealing with is a boundary edge. If it was then we apply our new special logic. The application of the logic was quite straightforward as we just did simple pointer traversal and summing like previously implemented. With these changes, support for boundary upscaling was implemented.
